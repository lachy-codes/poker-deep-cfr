Large imperfect information games are notoriously intractable. Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is the leading framework for solving games, two player games converging to Nash equilibrium. Ordinary CFR uses tables to store "regret values" which can be become difficult with large state spaces. Deep CFR solves this via neural approximation.
